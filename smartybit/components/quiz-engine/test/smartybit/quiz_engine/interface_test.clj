;; There is a pool of questions that are available for a quiz that is curated on the fly.
;; Each question has a difficulty level associated with it & the quiz adapts to it as follows:
;; - The level increases in difficulty when questions are answered correctly.
;; - The level decreases in difficulty when questions are answered incorrectly.
;; The next question will be fetched with the following rules:
;; - The questions are selected randomly from the pool.
;; - The first question is always a trivial question.
;; - The next question is harder than the previous question.
;; - The next question is easier than the previous question if answered incorrectly.
;; - The next question is possibly easier than the previous question if the pool is depleted of harder questions.
;; - The next question is never repeated.

;; A place to store a list of questions we can use to curate a quiz.
